From [Pixiv Guidelines](https://www.pixiv.net/terms/?page=guideline&lang=en):
> 
> ## About censorship (mosaics/pixelation)
> 
> * Generally speaking, the censorship process assumes that any inappropriate parts shall be hidden based on visual judgment rather than on the technical nature of the image.
> * Censorship shall be efficiently done until it has achieved a level where no programs can reverse the edit.
> * The range should include the outline.
> * Vague mosaics/pixelation where details are made clear by the transparency of the concealment shall not be considered as censorship.
> * The following are guidelines for using mosaics/pixelation:
>   
>   * Mosaics should use squares at least 4x4 pixels in size. If the said image is more than 400 pixels long, the dimensions of the mosaic squares should be 1/100 the length of the whole image.
> * Censorship using solid colors should conceal all inappropriate parts of the image. However, exceptions can be made if concealing only a part of the image leads to an acceptable result.
> * Censorship using white liquids and other patterns or painting techniques which goal is censorship should conceal all inappropriate parts of the image. However, exceptions can be made if concealing only a part of the image leads to an acceptable result.
> 
> ## Examples of expressions that require the use of mosaics/pixelation
> 
> * Genitals or areas reminiscent of genitals
> * The union or joining of the genitals and the insertion of foreign objects
> * The union or joining of anuses and the insertion of foreign objects
