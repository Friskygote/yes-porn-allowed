# Yes Porn Allowed

This is a list of sites and services that don't ban their usage in affiliation to adult content. It's important to not that each site, survice, platform, or business may have different limits. Additionally, some sites don't ban porn but do have "obscene content clauses". It is possible such clauses could be extended to adult content given company or governmental oppinion. Other sites openly allow/tolerate porn but are known to be hostile towards it's adult creators. Any such case will be noted. Lastly, this list is meant to document what I and other creators have found out in the wild.

> For a list of companies, sites, and services that have openly ban porn, check out ["No Porn Allowed"](https://github.com/Qwaxi-Lixard/no-porn-allowed).

# A Brief Disclaimer 

Same disclaimer as before: this list is very much US centric. I am an American artist and game dev. As such, this list contains either US or Global polocies. If these sites have a different stance for your country, please let me know here or on twitter (@QwaxiLixard). Moreover, I cannot exam every site that exist, so this list will always be non-exhaustive. If there is any site you feel should be added, feel free to send me a message.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Additionally*, I would like to say that this list does not mean these sites are "safe forever into the future" just that you *might* be safe *for now*. I highly recommend you keep your own personal backups of any work you do and keep those backups in multiple places. Most of these place are still a company or privately owned service at the end of the day. If throwing you under the bus makes more money, be ready to be thrown under that bus. Moreover, this list can be invalidated at a moment's notice. So, any help to keep this up-to-date would be greatly appreciated.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, any thing marked with :computer: are tools that provided the ability to host your own survice. Some may come with optional 1st party support others may not. The value in this is that you can easily migrate between services or create your own. Also, none of this is legal advice. I'm not lawyer. I'm just tired of digging through Terms of Services and Accetable Use Policies.

# By Survice Type
The following list the various services that exist. Each table includes a link (if allowable) to the company/site/service, what degree they tolerate/allow porn, and any potienital ticking time bombs.
